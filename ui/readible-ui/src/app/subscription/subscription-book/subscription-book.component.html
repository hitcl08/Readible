      <mat-card-content>Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble
        family tasked with ruling
        an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and
        enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for...

        When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny
        greater
        than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to
        fruition
        humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream
